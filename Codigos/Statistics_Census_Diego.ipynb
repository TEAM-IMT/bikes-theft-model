In general terms, the census information is segmented into different geographical units, such as: Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA), Census Division (CD), Census Branch (CSD), Census Area (CT) and Dissemination Area (DA).  For this study, the CT, which is a small and relatively stable area, will be taken as the geographic unit. Census areas usually have a population of 2,500 to 8,000 people. They are located in large urban centers that should have a central urban population of 50,000 or more.
