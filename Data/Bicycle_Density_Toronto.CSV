"Note"
"[1] The census assumes that the commute to work originates from the usual place of residence, but this may not always be the case. Sometimes, respondents may be on a business trip and may have reported their place of work or main mode of commuting based on where they were working during the trip. Some persons maintain a residence close to work and commute to their home on weekends. Students often work after school at a location near their school. As a result, the data may show unusual commutes or unusual main modes of commuting."
